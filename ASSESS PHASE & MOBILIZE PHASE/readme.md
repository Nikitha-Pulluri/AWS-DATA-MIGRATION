 # Cloud Migration Readiness Assessment

This repository focuses on understanding **cloud readiness assessment** in the context of cloud migration planning. It explains how organizations can evaluate their preparedness using AWS-provided tools: **Cloud Adoption Readiness Tool (CART)** and **Migration Readiness Assessment (MRA)**.

## Why Cloud Readiness Matters

Before migrating to the cloud, it's crucial to assess whether your **people**, **processes**, and **tools** are ready. Cloud readiness is more than a technical requirement — it’s an organizational shift. This phase ensures your team and systems are aligned for a smooth and successful migration.

## What is Readiness Assessment?

A readiness assessment helps identify:
- **Where your organization stands** in its cloud journey.
- **What strengths and weaknesses** exist in current infrastructure and processes.
- **What action plan** is needed to bridge the gaps.

It's like a compliance audit: you identify non-compliance areas, take action, and move closer to readiness certification — in this case, for cloud migration.

## 💸 Understanding the Migration Bubble

When migrating, organizations may temporarily experience increased costs — known as the **migration bubble**. This occurs due to:
- One-time assessment and consulting fees
- Tool usage and platform duplication
- Lease penalties and transition expenses
- Duplicate environments during testing/validation

Being prepared for these costs ensures smoother financial planning during cloud transition.

- Conduct MRA workshops
- Tailor recommendations to your business goals
- Help qualify you for MAP funding and tools
- Offer detailed reports, timelines, and stakeholder engagement plans
