# Cloud Migration Analogy: Plan, Prepare, Perform

## Introduction

For any organization's cloud journey, migration can be a **crucial step**. The sources draw an analogy, suggesting that migrating people is not very different from cloud application migration.

## Why Migrate?

Whether for people or organizations, the core reason for migration is to **make tomorrow better than today**.

For **people**, this could involve seeking better career or job prospects, better life expectancy, cost of living, living standards, safety, living conditions, or healthcare services. Migration can happen across countries, between cities, or from rural to urban areas. Even birds migrate when resources are scarce in a specific area.

For **organizations**, the concept is the same: they want to improve things for their applications and services. Cloud migration is presented as a logical move for organizations running traditional on-premise data centers. Common goals for moving to the cloud include:

*   **Accelerate business transformation**.
*   **Increase agility and innovate quickly**. Traditional on-premise environments often face challenges here compared to the cloud.
*   **Reduce operating cost**. This includes costs associated with maintaining data centers.
*   Access the **scale, performance, and operational benefits** cloud offers, such as using managed services or scaling applications.
*   **Improve security and compliance**, potentially by leveraging existing blueprints from a managed service provider to meet new requirements that are difficult to maintain on-premise.

**Understanding *why* you are migrating**, your main motivation, is considered the **most important aspect**. Knowing the why allows for better decision-making and increases the chance of migration success.

## The Migration Journey: Plan, Prepare, Perform

Whether it involves migrating people or cloud applications, the process typically unfolds in **three key steps**: **Plan**, **Prepare**, and **Perform**. While naming conventions may differ among cloud or service providers, these are the fundamental phases.

### Plan

This phase involves **assessing readiness**. For people, this means determining if you are ready to move and identifying any gaps related to required skills, legal requirements (like visas or security clearances), finances, family obligations, weather, schooling needs, social circles, pets, transportation, and accommodation. Identifying these needs helps assess readiness and reveals gaps.

For **organizations**, planning includes assessing the current readiness to make the move to the cloud. It involves figuring out the business outcome to achieve and building a business case to measure success after migration. It also means identifying gaps, which could be technical, business, operational, security-related, or tool-related. This phase is essentially assessing the current environment.

### Prepare

This phase is about **bridging the identified gaps** and **mobilizing resources**.

For people, if skills are lacking, they must be acquired. If legal requirements aren't met, they must be fulfilled (e.g., obtaining a visa or pet vaccination certificates). Other preparations include handling documentation for moving items like cars, managing finances and currency exchange, getting appropriate clothing, and booking travel and accommodation. This phase gets you ready to migrate and improves your state from the planning phase.

For **organizations**, the prepare phase starts once an inventory of what to migrate is ready. It involves determining how to migrate, aligning with the business case, addressing identified gaps, and getting ready. This might include training staff on cloud operation models or finding ways to move data from on-premise storage to the cloud. This is where you fix the identified gaps and get ready.

### Perform

This is the phase of **actually performing the migration**.

For people, this includes activities like handing over packages for shipping, carrying important documents, following best practices for travel (like arriving early or adhering to restrictions on items), and being ready to adjust to the new environment, routine, and way of doing things. Adjustment and potentially modernizing yourself based on the new place are required.

For **organizations**, this involves **migrating, validating, and optimizing**. This phase might utilize various approaches like Rehost, Replatform, and others. Optimization should ideally happen sooner rather than later after the migration.

The plan, prepare, and perform steps apply exactly the same to cloud migration as they do to people migration.

## Cost Expectations: The Migration Bubble

A common misunderstanding, particularly for businesses, is the expectation of a smooth transition to lower costs immediately upon moving to the cloud. The reality is that your cost will likely **increase initially** before coming down to the target operating cost you planned for. This initial increase is known as the **migration bubble**.

Activities that contribute to this temporary cost increase include:

*   One-time activities related to migration.
*   Planning and assessment costs, possibly involving hiring migration consultants.
*   Training your staff.
*   Using third-party tools for migration, which incurs temporary costs.
*   Running **duplicate environments** where workloads are active both on-premise and in the cloud simultaneously for a period of verification.
*   Potential lease penalties for breaking data center leases early.

This initial cost increase in the migration bubble is also evident in people migration, where costs rise due to expenses like ticketing, documentation verification, and transportation for goods. Awareness of this initial cost increase is important; the cost should stabilize to the target level later.
